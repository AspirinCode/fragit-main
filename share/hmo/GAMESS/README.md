# Generating Hybrid Molecular Orbitals for FMO

The hybrid molecular orbitals (HMOs) are essential ingredients in any FMO calculation using the hybrid orbital projector (HOP) when treating fragments connected by covalent bonds.
Here we include input and output of HMOs you can use in FragIt.

If you prepare HMOs for new basis sets please fork this repository, add your new HMOs along with input and output files and list them here along with any reference so they can be cited appropriately.
There are many HMOs (Pople and Dunnings basis sets) already distributed with GAMESS and the files included here are only a small subset of them all.

HMOs with a reference:
