h1. FragIt

FragIt is a python based tool that allows you to quickly fragment "any":http://openbabel.org/docs/2.3.0/FileFormats/Overview.html molecule and use the output as an input file in quantum chemistry programs that supports such fragment based methods.

FragIt was made out of the need to quickly benchmark many different molecules while developing a new fragment based method and is now being released in the hope that it is useful for others.

Currently, the only supported method is the "fragment molecular orbital":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_Molecular_Orbital method in "GAMESS":http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/index.html, but new output writers can be added easily to support other methods and programs.

There is also a version available which requires only a browser and Java. Look at "the FragIt homepage":http://www.fragit.org for more info.
