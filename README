FragIt is a python based tool that allows you to quickly fragment
a molecule and use the output as an input file in quantum chemistry
programs that supports such fragment based methods.

Currently, only the Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) method in GAMESS
is supported, but FragIt has been developed to easily allow for other
output writers to be added quickly.
